    <h1>Hello, it&apos;s Mec here.</h1>

		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>	
			As you may have got from the title, I'm Mec.
			I started playing with HTML and CSS since 2006 (which was a long time ago).
			I still remember the days when I wrote HTML pages using NotePad and opened them in IE6, 
			and when I could not distinguish between JSP and JavaScript. However, typing keyboard 
			is always fun, and writing programs is always fun (even an HTML page can hardly be viewed 
			as as a <code>program</code>, and I am always got fascinated by what computer can do.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of this journey I started over a decade ago, now I have got the chance
			to read, learn, write, and try different kinds of ideas with keyboards whenever I felt like to,
			which I really appreciate and enjoyed overall. Meanwhile, I think it may also be 
			the time to discover, to communicate, to challenge, and to share. That&apos;s why 
			this page has gone through an overhaul today, and it will be a place to host any thoughts I&apos;d
			like to publish in the coming years.

		<h2>Updated: 2018-03-01(Thu)</h2>
		<p>This home page is overhauled today to make it, well, viewable. Note that following following articles published 
		here should be: 1) written in plain static HTML, and 2) organized into different categories to adopt a pseudo-RESTful
		style. No guarantee on when will new content be published, or what will the content be. So chill down, and have fun :).</p>
